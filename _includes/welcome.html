    This page contains processed benchmark results of the
    <a href="https://speed.ruby-lang.org/" class="underline hover:no-underline">Ruby benchmark suite</a>
    from very begining. Here you can find how Ruby performance has changed relatively to the beginning of the
    journey when YJIT was introduced, but now also has ZJIT. The data is taken from the
    <a href="https://github.com/rubybench/benchmark-data" class="underline hover:no-underline">benchmark-data</a> repo.
